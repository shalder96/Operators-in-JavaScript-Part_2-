    <h2>Ternary Operator</h2>
    <p>The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is a concise way to write conditional expressions in JavaScript. It has the following syntax:</p>
    <p>
      <b>condition ?</b> expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse
      
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the condition is true, the expressionIfTrue is evaluated.</li>
      <li>If the condition is false, the expressionIfFalse is evaluated.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, let's write a program to check whether a number is even or odd using the ternary operator:</p>
    <img src="Asset/asset_1.png" alt="">
    <script>
      let number = 13;
      let result = (number%2==0)? "It is even number":"It is odd number";
      console.log(result)
      //It is odd number
    </script>
</body>
